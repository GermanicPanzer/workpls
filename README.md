# Hello.
Welcome to my website repo! How did you get here? Anyways, here's a tutorial cus why not?

If you want to deploy this website as your own, use Netlify or Glitch. Click the buttons below to do that. I suggest using Netlify as it is less buggy, but Glitch is good too. Also, they come with random generated names.
In order to change the name on Netlify, go to domain settings, and click on "Change Site Name". For Glitch, you need to pay to change a name.

This tutorial can be used for other things on github.
