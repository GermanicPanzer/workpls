  <h1>Help us!</h1>
  <p>
    If you are interested in helping us, it is recommended to join my 
    discord server. The invite code is gBSWchhKph. If you are unable to, here are some 
    notes:<br> New websites are always blocked, even if they aren't proxies.
    In order to get past that, we use "hosters", which host websites.<br>
    The hosters we know are glitch.com and netlify, there are probably more.
    I suggest using Holy Unblocker, as that is easier to deploy.<br> 
    There should be some colorful buttons that say "deploy to (inset site here)".
    Replit, CodeSandbox, Herokuapp, and some more are all blocked.<br> The only ones
    that we know that work are glitch.com and netlify, as I said above.
    For a more detailed explanation, join the discord server.
