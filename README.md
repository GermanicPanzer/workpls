# Hello.
Welcome to my website repo! How did you get here? Anyways, here's a tutorial cus why not.

If you want to deploy this website as your own, use Netlify or Glitch. Click the buttons below to do that. I suggest using Netlify as it is less buggy, but Glitch is good too. Also, they come with random generated names.
In order to change the name on Netlify, go to domain settings, and click on "Options" then "Change Site Name". For Glitch, you need to pay to change a name.

This tutorial can be used for other things on github.

If you say some suggestions, go in the "Discussions" tab and say something. If you want to edit your own website and not mine (this one), click on the "Fork" button. Then, click on the file you want to change. The file names are the pages on the website. After you do that, cick the pencil button on the top right. It should show some HTML code unless you clicked on the CSS file. If you ever did the CTRL + Shift + J thing, I think you'll be able to figure it out.

The original website for this is panzerzone.netlify.app
